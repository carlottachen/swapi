1. The POST request requires a body that has a text property.  It should also 
send the id and date stamp, which are sent as a number and a string.
2. The GET request returns an array of all the posts.
3. https://github.com/DevMountain/react-3-afternoon/555
4. 200 and 409
5. https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=Carlotta
    {
        "id": 280,
        "text": "Testing testing 123 Carlotta",
        "date": "01 Dec 2021"
    },
6. https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=Blue
  {
    "id": 280,
    "text": "Blue",
    "date": "01 Dec 2021"
  },
7. https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?text=Blue
8. content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
9. Entering a body parameter that is not "text"
10. If I try to send a query in the GET request URL, it will either 
return the filtered item requested if I use
https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter?id=280.  However,
if I use https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts?id=280, then it
returns the entire array as expected since the URL isn't looking for a
specific post.
